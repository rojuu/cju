# cju, a toy compiler

A toy compiler written in C++17

## Building
Do the following:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

NOTE: you need to make sure that cmake generates the project to use a compiler that supports C++17. For that you will need to refer to the [cmake documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) for the platform you are on.
